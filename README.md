Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict customer churn for a bank. Churn prediction is essential for banks to identify customers who are likely to leave the service, enabling them to take proactive steps to retain these customers.

Project Description
Customer churn is when a customer stops using a bank's services. Predicting churn allows the bank to engage with customers at risk of leaving and offer incentives or improved services to retain them. This project uses a combination of feature engineering and machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn based on their historical data.

Data
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:

Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender)
Account information (e.g., balance, number of products)
Transaction history
Customer activity (e.g., number of transactions, active status)
The data is assumed to be in a CSV file format and can be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for preprocessing and analysis.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-customer-churn.git
cd bank-customer-churn
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to train the model, evaluate it, and make predictions.

Running the Model
To train the model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
To make predictions on new data:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input data/new_customers.csv
Model
The model pipeline includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for the model.
Model Training: Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to train the model.
Model Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search to optimize model performance.
Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
AUC-ROC
These metrics provide insight into how well the model predicts churn and the trade-offs between different types of errors.

Results
After training and tuning, the model achieves an accuracy of X% with a precision of Y% and a recall of Z%. The AUC-ROC score is W, indicating the model's ability to distinguish between churned and non-churned customers.
